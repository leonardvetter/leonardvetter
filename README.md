# Hi, I’m Leonard

I’m a mathematician, focussing on **probability theory** and exploring **mechanistic interpretability of AI** through the lens of **random graph theory**. I love uncovering the hidden structure that lets complex systems (from neurons to networks) compute.

## 🔬 Research snapshot

| Year | Title & link | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 2025 | **Condensation in subcritical Cauchy Bienaymé trees** <br>*(with Igor Kortchemski)* • Electron. Commun. Probab. 30: 1-13 (2025). DOI: [10.1214/25-ECP726](https://doi.org/10.1214/25-ECP726) | Shows that the so called condensation phenomenon for BGW-trees also occurs in the case, where the offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law of index 1. This completes the study of the height of heavy-tailed size-conditioned Bienaymé trees.

*Always looking for collaborations at the juncture of probability, random graphs & deep learning.*
