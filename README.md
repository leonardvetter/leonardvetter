# Hi there, I’m Leonard Vetter 👋

I’m a mathematician, focussing on **probability theory** and exploring **mechanistic interpretability** through the lens of **random graph theory**. I love uncovering the hidden structure that lets complex systems (from neurons to networks) compute.

## 🔬 Research snapshot

| Year | Title & link | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 2025 | **Condensation in subcritical Cauchy Bienaymé trees** <br>*(with Igor Kortchemski)* • [arXiv 2503.07530](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07530) | Shows that the so called condensation phenomenon for BGW-trees also occurs in the case, where the offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law of index 1. This completes the study of the height of heavy-tailed size-conditioned Bienaymé trees.

*Always looking for collaborations at the juncture of probability, random graphs & deep learning.*
